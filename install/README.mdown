Gentoo Root on ZFS
==================

Instructions are available for running Gentoo on a root ZFS filesystem.  Two approaches are given, depending on your current status:

* [Migrate an existing system to ZFS root](GentooMigration.mdown "Instructions for migrating an existing Gentoo system to ZFS")
* [Install a fresh system on ZFS using a ZFS livecd](GentooInstall.mdown "Instructions for installing a fresh Gentoo on ZFS")
